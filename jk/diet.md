Diet
=====

The diet of dragons seems to be obscure and difficult to ascertain. The books that discuss this topic seem to contradict each other. Dragons, being solitary creatures that seem to stick with other dragons and their few favored humans, probably eat in private.

Thus their eating habits are most difficult to verify. Both reports are presented here so the reader can have access to the research available.
Dragons enjoy milk, maidens, cakes, birds, oxen, deer, and elephants' blood.  Milk is their favorite drink. It makes them sleepy and too drunk to harm anyone.
