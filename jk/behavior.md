Behaviour
=====


Dragons are fascinating not only in appearance and ability, but in personality as well.

The Social life of Dragons
-------

Dragons are highly advanced social creatures, and can be very emotional at times.
Granted, there are good and evil dragons, but there are also Good and evil Humans too. Evilness is a natural a trail as having green scales (no typecasting here). Dragons can range greatly in their personalities, from very complex characters to rather dull individuals. Some dragons are kind and caring. Some are ruthless and cruel. But each is mentaly unique, and has their own place in a dragon society.

Clans, Families and Gathers
--------
Dragons have a very structured social machine. There are thousands of clans, cults, flights, and gathers of dragons. Each different, each with a leader, each with a purpose. Dragons are very loyal, and respectful. Honor everything, even the opponent at war-time. And a Dragon almost always keeps his word.
